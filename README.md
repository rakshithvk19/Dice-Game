# Dice-Game

This is the second project that I built over the duration of learning the course
'The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

Description:
This is a dice game where 2 players roll a 6 faced dice and the score is calculated. The score to win the game is 20 points. Each time a player rolls a dice, the number on the dice gets added to the previous score. If the dice is rolled to 1, then the current score is lost and the chance to roll the dice goes to the next player. The UI of current player is highlighted to that users understands whos turn is it currently.
The player can hold the current score by pressing the hold button which saves his current score and addes it to previous score, while the chance to roll goes to the next player.
If the score of the player turns 20 or more and chooses to hold the game he would be declared as the winner.
On winning the game, clicking the new button will reset the game and loser gets to chance to roll the dice.
Have fun!!
